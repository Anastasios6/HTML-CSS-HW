        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
        web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
        semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. HTML
        elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
        the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
        lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
        tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and /p surround
        and provide information about document text and may include sub-element
        tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret
        the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting
        language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of
        web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and
        current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known
        as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas
        element, together with JavaScript.

        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
        prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
        documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
        hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser
        and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data
        systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
        funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his
        personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in
        which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5] The
        first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML
        Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
        1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
        simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
        influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup
        Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these
        elements still exist in HTML 4.[9] HTML is a markup language that web
        browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material
        into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every
        item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these
        characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's
        additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the
        1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which
        describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that
        used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
        (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting
        commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
        format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is
        based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than
        merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
        progressively moved in this direction with CSS. Berners-Lee considered
        HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by
        the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication
        of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
        Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which
        included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[10][11]
        The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its
        acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding
        in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on
        successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet
        Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
        standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out
        forms.[12] After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the
        IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group
        completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be
        treated as a standard against which future implementations should be
        based.[13] Further development under the auspices of the IETF was
        stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have
        been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the
        World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[14] In 2000, HTML became an
        international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in
        late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004,
        development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology
        Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in
        2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[15
