        Counter-Strike 2 is a 2023 free-to-play tactical first-person shooter
        game developed and published by Valve. It is the fifth entry in the
        Counter-Strike series, developed as an updated version of the previous
        entry, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2012). The game was announced
        on March 22, 2023, and was released on September 27, 2023, for Windows
        and Linux, replacing Global Offensive on Steam. Like its predecessor,
        the game pits two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists,
        against each other in various objective-based game modes; additional
        game modes that stray away from this setup are also included.
        Counter-Strike 2 features major technical improvements over Global
        Offensive, including a move from the Source game engine to Source 2,
        improved graphics, and a new "sub-tick" server architecture. In
        addition, many maps from Global Offensive were updated to take advantage
        of the features of Source 2, with some maps receiving complete
        overhauls. Upon release, Counter-Strike 2 received generally favorable
        reviews from critics, with praise for its gunplay and overhauled maps.
        In contrast, player reception was mixed, and the game received thousands
        of negative user reviews on Steam, becoming one of the lowest-rated
        Valve titles on the platform; criticism was directed at the game's
        performance, the removal of several features that had been present in
        Global Offensive, and the discontinuation of support for the macOS
        operating system, which was supported by Global Offensive.

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>

    <div class="gameplay">

      <p>
        Counter-Strike 2 is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter, in
        which two teams, the Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, compete to
        complete various objectives.[1][2] The game includes two round-based
        objective scenarios: bomb defusal and hostage rescue, with the bomb
        defusal scenario making up the primary gameplay experience.[2] New
        gameplay features in Counter-Strike 2 include volumetric "smoke
        physics", a feature where the smoke generated by a smoke grenade grows
        to fill spaces, and can be altered in real time by gunshots or through
        the use of hand grenades.[3][4] Additionally, the game features a
        revised weapon loadout system, which only allows players to bring five
        pistols, five "mid-tier" weapons (i.e submachine guns and shotguns), and
        five rifles with them into a match, for a total of fifteen weapons.[5]
        In standard bomb defusal matches, the Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist
        teams each have five players. In these game modes, eliminated players do
        not respawn until the next round.[2] Within each round, the goal of the
        Terrorist team is to plant a bomb at one of two bombsites on the map and
        defend the bombsite until the bomb explodes. The Terrorist team can also
        win the round by eliminating the Counter-Terrorist team. The
        Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them by running out the round clock,
        killing all Terrorists, or defusing the explosive. In a hostage rescue
        match, the Counter-Terrorist team act as the attackers, attempting to
        rescue non-player character "hostages" that the Terrorist team are
        defending.[6] At the start of each round, players are able to purchase
        different weapons and equipment. A standard match ends when a team wins
        thirteen rounds.[2][7] The game features two primary matchmaking modes:
        Competitive and Premier,[6][7] both of which were previously featured in
        Global Offensive.[8] Competitive is a direct continuation of Global
        Offensive's matchmaking system; players can choose to play any map, and
        ranks are now determined on a per-map basis.[9] Premier plays similarly
        to Competitive, but instead of allowing the players to queue into any
        individual map, Premier uses a seven-map pool with a voting and banning
        system. It also follows a revised ranking system, whereby—in lieu of
        Global Offensive's ranking system, which grouped players into eighteen
        different skill ranks—players are given a numerical rating based on
        their performance.[7][9] Supplementing Counter-Strike 2's primary game
        modes are four additional modes: Wingman,[10] Casual,[2] Deathmatch,[7]
        and Arms Race.[11] Wingman is a bomb defusal match, but with only two
        players per team, one bombsite, and matches ending after a team wins
        nine rounds.[10] Casual is another bomb defusal mode, but with no
        ranking system and an increase in the number of players on each team.[2]
        Deathmatch puts players into a match with no map objective, and players
        trying to achieve the most kills before the match ends.[6] Arms Race
        plays very differently from other modes, featuring no money system or
        menu to buy weapons. Instead, players are given new weapons after
        successive kills, with the weapons progressively becoming less powerful
        and more difficult.[12] The first player to get kills with all weapons,
        including a final kill with a knife, wins the game.[11]

        Valve developed Counter-Strike 2 with the Source 2 game engine as an
        update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2012).[13] Various aspects
        of Global Offensive were updated during development to use the features
        of Source 2.[14] It is the first entry in the Counter-Strike series in
        over ten years.[15] In addition to the engine changes, the game was
        developed alongside new server architecture, allowing for "sub-tick"
        gameplay that more accurately synchronizes with player input.[16][17]
        Valve Studio Orchestra also produced a new soundtrack for Counter-Strike
        2, which was released to digital platforms by Ipecac Recordings on
        November 1, 2023.[18] Many maps from Global Offensive were given
        upgrades to take advantage of the features of Source 2, including new
        lighting and physically based materials.[19][4] Valve created three
        different groups to place maps into when reconstructing them:
        "Touchstone" for maps that were unchanged in layout (ex. Dust II),
        "Upgrades" for maps given large-scale graphical upgrades with the
        features of Source 2 (ex. Nuke), and "Overhauls" for maps reconstructed
        from the ground up (ex. Inferno).[19][17] Additionally, all cosmetic
        items from Global Offensive, including weapon skins and knives, were
        transferred to Counter-Strike 2.[20]

    <h2>Release</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="release">
      <p>
        Following rumors of a Source 2 update for Global Offensive earlier that
        month,[21] Counter-Strike 2 was officially announced on March 22, 2023,
        and three videos demonstrating changes made from Global Offensive were
        released.[22] Later that day, a beta version of Counter-Strike 2, known
        as the "Limited Test", was released to select Global Offensive
        players.[23] Throughout the existence of the Limited Test, new aspects
        of the game were made available for testing via updates, including
        upgraded maps,[24] the revised weapon loadout system,[25] and new
        authoring tools that allow players to design custom maps, weapon skins,
        and stickers.[26] On September 1, 2023, the Limited Test was released to
        all that purchased Global Offensive before it became free-to-play in
        2018 and were active in competitive matchmaking.[27] Counter-Strike 2
        released to the public on September 27, 2023, replacing Global Offensive
        on Steam.[28] This took Global Offensive down,[29] with the exception of
        community servers, which are accessible via a "legacy" branch of Global
        Offensive.[30] Several features from Global Offensive were removed,
        including the "Arms Race" and "Danger Zone" game modes,[31] various
        multiplayer maps, such as Train and Cache,[32] and all 167 in-game
        achievements.[33] In addition, support for the macOS operating system
        and older hardware configurations, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit
        operating systems, was discontinued, with future updates for
        Counter-Strike 2 being set to release only on 64-bit Windows and Linux
        systems.[34]
      </p>
      <h4>Monetization</h4>
      <p>
        As with Global Offensive, Counter-Strike 2 employs a free-to-play
        model;[35] players are able to access the majority of the game's
        contents without paying an up-front fee,[36] with the exception of the
        Premier game mode, access to which requires the purchase of a "Prime"
        status upgrade.[37] Players who choose to purchase the Prime upgrade
        also obtain access to a weekly "care package" drop, which they earn
        through gaining experience points and leveling up their profile within a
        Prime-exclusive leveling system.[36][38] Upon earning a care package,
        players are presented with four rewards, which can include weapon skins,
        weapon cases (i.e loot boxes), and graffiti sprays, and must select two
        of these rewards.[38] Additionally, players can acquire cosmetic items
        through the Steam Community Market[39] or via "The Armory"—a battle
        pass-style progression system, which allows players to earn "Armory
        credits" and redeem them in the Armory for various items, including
        weapon cases, weapon skins, stickers, and weapon charms.[40]
      </p>
      <h4>Post-release updates</h4>
      <p>
        In November 2023, Steam Workshop support was enabled for Counter-Strike
        2, allowing players to submit custom maps to the Workshop and play them
        in offline matches and on community-hosted servers.[41] In February
        2024, Global Offensive's Arms Race game mode was added to Counter-Strike
        2 as part of the "Call to Arms" update;[42] the update also includes
        revised versions of the Global Offensive maps "Baggage" and "Shoots",
        adjustments to the "Zeus" taser weapon, and the "Kilowatt Case", a
        weapon case containing 17 community-created weapon skins.[42][43] In
        April 2024, left-handed weapon "view model" settings were added to
        Counter-Strike 2,[44] following their absence from the game's initial
        release,[45] and Dust II was added to the map pool of the Premier game
        mode, replacing Overpass.[46] In May 2024, a rental system for the
        Kilowatt Case was added, allowing players who have obtained a key for
        the case to rent all weapon skins within it for one week.[47] In June
        2024, five community-made maps—"Thera", "Mills", "Memento", "Assembly",
        and "Pool Day"—were added to Counter-Strike 2;[48] these were replaced
        by the maps "Basalt", "Edin", "Palais", and "Whistle" via an update in
        November 2024, which also added an overhauled version of Train.[49]

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="reception">
      <h4>Critical reception</h4>
      <p>
        Counter-Strike 2 received "generally favorable reviews", according to
        the review aggregator website Metacritic, which calculated a weighted
        average rating of 82/100, based on 16 critic reviews.[50] OpenCritic
        determined that 88% of critics recommended the game.[51] Jake Tucker of
        TechRadar gave Counter-Strike 2 a 4 out of 5 star rating; Tucker praised
        the game's "clean" gunplay and "silken" movement, but criticized its
        hostility to new players and lack of accessibility features.[2]
        Eurogamer's Will Judd also gave the game a 4 out of 5 star rating,
        commending its moment-to-moment gunplay and overhauled maps, but
        critiquing its stability and lack of alternative game modes that deviate
        from its focus on competitive play.[53] Chris Shive of Hardcore Gamer
        stated that Counter-Strike 2 is a "mostly positive update to Global
        Offensive", and gave it a 4/5 rating.[6] Polygon's Charlie Theel called
        Counter-Strike 2 "a significant move forward for the franchise",
        praising the game's changes to weapon handling, visuals, sound design
        and art direction.[58] Ed Thorn, reviews editor for Rock Paper Shotgun,
        stated that Counter-Strike 2 "captures what makes Counter-Strike tick",
        though he noted that the game's foundation seemed "a little sparse and a
        touch shaky" upon its initial release but felt confident that Valve
        "have an FPS that'll supersede Global Offensive in time."[7] PC Gamer's
        Rich Stanton commented that his transition to Counter-Strike 2 from
        Global Offensive felt like playing a "director's cut" version of
        something he'd already played before, rather than a new experience.[3]
      </p>
      <h4>Player reception</h4>
      <p>
        Initial responses from players were critical of the removal of several
        game modes that were present in Global Offensive, such as Arms Race and
        Danger Zone,[59] the discontinuation of support for the macOS operating
        system, which was previously supported by Global Offensive,[31] and the
        removal of all in-game achievements.[33] Due to the removed content, the
        game received thousands of negative reviews on Steam, most of which were
        hidden by the 7.5 million reviews previously made for Global Offensive,
        the majority of which were positive.[60][61] Graham Smith of Rock Paper
        Shotgun commented that Counter-Strike 2 should not have been able to use
        reviews from Global Offensive to prop itself up as the two were
        different games, and that if user reviews only included those for
        Counter-Strike 2, the store page would show a mixed feedback from
        players equivalent to 59%.[61] In October 2023, PCGamesN and Den of Geek
        reported that Counter-Strike 2 had become the lowest-rated Valve release
        on Steam, with the game's performance and removed content being
        considered primary criticisms from players.[62][63]
      </p>
      <h4>Revenue</h4>
      <p>
        According to reports from Eurogamer and Dot Esports, Counter-Strike 2
        generated an estimated US$1 billion in revenue through the sale of loot
        boxes by the end of 2023, with a total of over 400 million loot boxes
        being opened throughout the entirety of that year.[64][65]
